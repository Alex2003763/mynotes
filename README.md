## About The Project

mynotes is a modern note-taking application built with React and TypeScript. It leverages the power of Editor.js for rich text editing capabilities, allowing users to create, edit, and organize notes with various content blocks like paragraphs, headers, lists, tables, and more. The application uses IndexedDB for client-side storage (via the idb library) and features a clean, responsive interface with date-fns for date handling and tinycolor2 for color manipulation. Designed to run locally with Vite for fast development and hot module replacement.
